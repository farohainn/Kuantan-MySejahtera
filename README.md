This is the main screen of Kuantan MySejahtera application. The design was too simple since this is my first project developing android using Android Studio. 
The main point to develop is because I live in Kuantan and I see a lot of people in Kuantan was not aware of the technology to scanning barcode and most of street stall doen't provide a barcode.

So, this is the interface where people can take a picture of the stall to proof that they are check-in to that place. Meanwhile in this application also provide emergency number from Ministry of Health in Malaysia.
